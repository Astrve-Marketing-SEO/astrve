Please update this section to match our website's dark and gold theme with these specific requirements:

1. Background colors:
   - Main backgrounds: Use bg-rich-black for large sections
   - Card/panel backgrounds: Use bg-rich-dark/90 with subtle gold borders (border-gold-500/20)
   - Interactive elements: Use gold gradients for primary buttons, rich-dark/90 with gold accents for secondary
   - Add a darkening overlay (bg-rich-black/80) as a base layer to improve text readability

2. Text colors:
   - Main headings: Use text-foreground with drop shadows for readability
   - Accent text: Use gold-gradient-text for important headings, text-gold-400 for emphasis
   - Body text: Use text-gray-300 on dark backgrounds for proper contrast
   - Stats/numbers: Use text-foreground with gold accents

3. Font families:
   - Headings: Apply font-serif throughout
   - UI elements/buttons: Use font-serif for consistent styling
   - Body text and smaller elements: Use font-sans

4. Visual elements:
   - Add subtle gold gradients (from-gold-300/20 to-transparent opacity-20) for glows and highlights
   - Reduce opacity of decorative elements to 20% to prevent washing out text
   - Use border-gold-500/20 for subtle borders that define sections
   - Apply rounded-lg or rounded-2xl for panels/cards
   - Use gold progress bars (bg-gold-400, bg-gold-500) on rich-gray/90 backgrounds
   - Add z-index to important content elements to ensure proper layering

5. Interactive components:
   - Charts/graphs: Use gold colors (rgb(255, 186, 0)) instead of default blues/greens
   - Progress bars: Use rich-gray/90 backgrounds with gold indicators
   - Buttons: Gold primary buttons with dark text, dark secondary buttons with gold text
   - Add shadow-lg to buttons and interactive elements for better depth

6. Contrast optimization:
   - Ensure decorative blur elements don't exceed 20-30% opacity
   - Use semi-transparent backgrounds (bg-*/90) to better integrate with the dark theme
   - Add subtle shadows to important UI elements to help them stand out
   - Position important content with z-10 to ensure it sits above background effects

Please ensure all elements maintain good contrast ratios and the overall aesthetic remains consistent with our dark and gold luxury theme.
